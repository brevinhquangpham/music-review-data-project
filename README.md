# Project overview

This project aims to scrape and analyze music review data from Rate Your Music (RYM), a community-driven music database and review site. By examining user reviews and ratings, we seek to uncover insights into music trends, genre popularity, and factors contributing to an album's acclaim or criticism.

# Data Source
